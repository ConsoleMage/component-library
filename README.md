# Solo Project Component Library

A solo project from Scrimba, completed from scratch. The task was to build reusable components in React based on a provided Figma design file.

This was an interesting challenge—learning how to use React dependencies in my local environment. I had some trouble setting up the basic structure of the project, but after resolving that, I had to figure out why `.js` wasn't compiling properly during runtime. It turned out to be related to the cloud service environment's special configuration.

After finishing the components, it was time to deploy them, but I ran into a few roadblocks. Specifically, I struggled to figure out the correct paths for my assets, as `npm start` and `npm run preview` behave differently—the former is for development, while the latter is for production.

Having worked through all of that, I think I could still improve by refactoring my code and revisiting some decisions about how rigid or flexible certain components should be. Overall, though, I'm quite satisfied with the results.
